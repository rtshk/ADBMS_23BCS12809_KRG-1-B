/*
Problem Title: NPV Lookup Using LEFT JOIN

You have two tables:
1. Year_tbl: contains actual NPV (Net Present Value) for different years and IDs.
2. Queries: contains (ID, YEAR) pairs for which you want to find the NPV.

Goal:
Return the queried (ID, YEAR) pairs along with the corresponding NPV value.
If NPV doesn't exist for that (ID, YEAR), show 0.

CREATE TABLE Year_tbl (
    ID INT,
    YEAR INT,
    NPV INT
);

CREATE TABLE Queries (
    ID INT,
    YEAR INT
);

INSERT INTO Year_tbl (ID, YEAR, NPV)
VALUES
(1, 2018, 100),

(2, 2008, 121),
(3, 2009, 12),
(11, 2020, 99),

SELECT 
    Q.ID,
    Q.YEAR,
    ISNULL(Y.NPV, 0) AS NPV
FROM 
    Queries AS Q
LEFT JOIN
